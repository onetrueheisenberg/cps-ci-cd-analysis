# Archive of Non-Size-Optimization Files

This directory contains files that were not directly related to Docker image
size optimization and were moved here during the repository cleanup.

## Contents

- **Research Analysis**: Excel, Numbers, and CSV files from manual analysis (RQ1, RQ2, RQ3)
- **Non-Size CSVs**: Files related to bad practices, challenges, mitigation strategies

These files are preserved for reference but are not part of the active size optimization pipeline.
